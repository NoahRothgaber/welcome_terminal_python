# welcome_terminal_python
A script used initially to setup aliases (incomplete), install additional services (incomplete) and store some basic user info to make calls to PyOwm api (weather). 
Once ran once following executions will; 
                                        Print custom greeting, 
                                        print current weather at provided city/state, 
                                        print dad joke, 
                                        and prompt for updates via apt (incomplete). 
If you are to use this program yourself, you will need to provide an open weather map api key in a file called "dont_commit".
